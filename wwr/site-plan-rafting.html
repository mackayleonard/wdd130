    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/f5dfbb-f25757-a6e1fa-070707-070707"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a>

    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>f5dfbb</th>
        <th>f25757</th>
        <th>a6e1fa 1</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">#f5dfbb</td>
        <td class="secondary">#f25757</td>
        <td class="accent1">#a6e1fa</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>
      Heading Font: "Kanit", sans-serif;
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Paragraph Font: "Roboto Mono", monospace;
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>Believe it or not, some of the best White Water Rafting can be found 
      in Arizona! Come and check out the upper Salt River if you are looking for a
      cool adventure, and if you are a more experienced river rafter!
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      There are more places to raft especially for families! Places like the Telluride's San Miguel (ages 8 and up),
      and Durango, and Pagosa's Upper Piedra River (ages 12 and up). These are family friendly to all who are coming!
