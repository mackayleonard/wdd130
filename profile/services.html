  <p>
    Here I created a side bar nav which instead of displaying at the top of the page, the nav is now displayed at the side of the page
  </p>

  <p>I'm honestly not 100% sure if there is any advantage to this style of nav bar vs the traditional nav bar other than style.</p>

  <p>If you have a lot of different pages that you are working to creating, it could be more useful to have this style of nav bar in order to have more organization.</p>
